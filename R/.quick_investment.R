To finance these investments, countries rely on gross domestic savings (GDS, which equals GDP minus final consumption expenditure) or, when these are insufficient, they must borrow from abroad (Net Foreign Borrowing = NFB). If NFB is positive (investment > savings), the country is investing more than it saves domestically, indicating it needs to borrow from abroad or attract foreign investment to finance the gap. This results in a current account deficit (NFB = - Current Account). Overall, investment in the economy follows two key identities:
GCF = GFCF + Î”Inventories and GCF = GDS + Net Foreign Borrowing where changes in inventories can be either positive or negative.

# #####################################
# Option==1, why keep CU and GCF to deduce GDS?
# 
# When working with these three measures, your decision on which variable to deduce should be based on data reliability. Here's my analysis:
#
# Current Account (CA) data tends to be the most reliable because:
# It involves actual international transactions
# It's carefully tracked by central banks
# It's subject to double-entry bookkeeping
# It's cross-checked with other countries' records
# International institutions (IMF) closely monitor it
#
#
# Gross Capital Formation (GCF/Investment) data is generally the second most reliable because:
# It involves concrete transactions
# It's based on measurable physical investments
# It's tracked through both expenditure and production approaches
# It has clear accounting standards
#
#
# Gross Domestic Savings is often the least reliable because:
# It's typically calculated as a residual in national accounts
# It incorporates measurement errors from GDP calculations
# It can include informal sector activities
# It's affected by statistical discrepancies in national accounts
#
# Therefore:
# Keep CA and GCF as your base measures
# Calculate Savings as: NY_GDS_TOTL_ZS = NE_GDI_TOTL_ZS + Current Account
